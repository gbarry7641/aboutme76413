<h2> The Kid from Back Then<h2/>

	<p>Some have unique perspective on me. But most of the time I am known as a kid that has an "old soul". I would consider
		myself to have morals and ethics that which come from the old days. I am a humble and kind individual that puts other's
		before myself. You may see me by myself with not a lot of people to talk to. That's because there is not a lot of people
		that I can relate to. Sometimes it may be difficult to understand me, but you can call me "Little Man"</p>
<h2> I enjoy...</h2>
<li>Helping others</li> <li>Playing basketball</li> <li>Writing rap lyrics</li><li>Getting to spend time with my spiritual big brother</li><li>Learning about society and the world we reside in</li><li>Earning the respect from others who see the effort that I put into something</li><li>Watching some good movies</li><li>Making my mother and big brother proud.</li>
<h2> I don't enjoy...</h2>
<li>People disrespecting me</li><li>Being offensive towards those I love and care for</li><li>Not being seen for the true human being I am</li><li>Metaphorical blood sucking leeches</li>
